# This is my humble neovim configuration (tested on nvim v0.9.4 (nvim version is very important)).
Used vim-plug(https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug) plugin manager. (see https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug for installation). \
First you need to install vim-plug, then copy init.vim to you '~/.config/nvim' folder (generally to your nvim config folder) (linux only) then install language servers (with ':LspInstall' command in nvim) \
Also for correct display for some logos on bottom status bar you need some NerdFont installed on your machine.
